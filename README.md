**Ethereum Price Prediction Project**
This project predicts Ethereum's future prices based on historical data using machine learning models like Random Forest and Extra Trees. The data is sourced from an API for the last 365 days.

**Features**
1.Predicts Ethereum prices based on the latest 365 days of data from an API.
2.Machine learning models: Random Forest and Extra Trees.
3.User-friendly web interface for viewing predictions.

**Technologies Used**
1.Python
2.Django
3.Random Forest and Extra Trees algorithms
4.Pandas (for data handling)
5.Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
6.Requests (for fetching data from the API)
